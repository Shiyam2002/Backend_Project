I am currently developing a comprehensive backend system for healthcare appointment scheduling using Spring Boot. The project is designed to streamline the management of patient appointments, from registration to scheduling, aiming to enhance the efficiency and service delivery in healthcare facilities.

The system enables secure patient registration, capturing personal, contact, and insurance information with robust data validation. Patients can update their details as needed, ensuring that their information remains accurate. The appointment scheduling feature allows patients to book appointments based on doctor availability, time slots, and specializations, while managing conflicts to present only available options. Users can also view appointments by date or doctor, making it easy for both patients and healthcare providers to manage their schedules.

To support the functionality, I have integrated key technologies:

Postman for API testing and validation,
Spring JPA for smooth database interactions with MySQL,
Log4j for logging and auditing activities, ensuring traceability and system performance monitoring,
A custom ResponseHandler for structured and consistent API responses,
Global Exception Handling to gracefully manage errors and provide clear feedback to users.
As the project is still in development, I am continually adding new features and refining the system, with plans for future enhancements such as notification services, reminders, and payment integration. This backend project lays a solid foundation for improving appointment management and the overall patient experience in healthcare systems.
